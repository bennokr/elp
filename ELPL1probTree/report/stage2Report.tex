\maketitle

The CKY algorithm was originally implemented for binary rules only. We extended the code to support unary rules.
\section{Implementation}
\paragraph{Grammar}
\begin{itemize}
\item We created a general class {\tt Rule} to replace the {\tt BinaryRule} and {\tt UnaryRule} classes. Occurrences of {\tt Rule} can be either binary or unary rules. The method {\tt getChildren()} returns an array of Strings. This enables other functions to iterate over the children in a more general way.

\item We extended the class {\tt Grammar} with {\tt UnaryClosedGrammar}, which is a grammar that computes and stores the unary closure of all unary rules after instantiation. The methods {\tt getUnaryRulesByParent(String)} and {\tt getUnaryRulesByChild} are guaranteed to return the unary closure of unary rules.

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Parsing}
\begin{itemize}
\item 
The Parsing algorithm itself is run with the function {\tt getBestParse(List<String>)}. The pseudocode of the algorithm is as follows:
\begin{program}
\mbox{match preterminal productions}

\FOR max=1 : 1 :  n
      \FOR min = max-1 : -1 : 0
              \FOREACH C \in syntacticCategories
\FOREACH R \in binary rules
\FOR mid = min+1 : 1: max-1
	          \mbox{match binary rule, keep the best scoring rule and its midpoint}
\END
\END
              \mbox{store the best rule and midpoint in the chart}
\END
 \FOREACH C \in syntacticCategories
\FOREACH R \in unary closure
 \mbox{match unary rule, keep the best scoring rule}
\END
\IF (bestScoringUnary > bestStoredInChart)
\mbox{replace this position in the chart with the unary rule}
           
\END
\END
\END
\END

\end{program}
\item After performing the CKY parsing, the tree is recovered by traversing the backpointers in the chart. 
We altered the classes {\tt Chart} and {\tt EdgeInfo} such that an {\tt EdgeInfo} object has a certain {\tt type}: preterminal, unary, or binary. When the {\tt set} function of {\tt Chart} is called with 3, 4, or 5 parameters, the appropriate constructor for {\tt EdgeInfo} is called. The parameters always include the {\tt i} and {\tt j}, the end points of the edge, and {\tt label} its label. The optional arguments are a {\tt Rule} object and a {\tt midpoint}

We rewrote the methods {\tt traverseBackPointers} and {\tt traverseBackPointersHelper}. 
\end{itemize}
